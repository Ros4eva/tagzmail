GetProspect [https://getprospect.io/public/img/logo.png]
 Happy 2020, Ademola! We wish you a successful year ahead, bringing you new=
 customers, successful sales and luck in all your achievements.

At the end of the previous year, our team made a lot of improvements to Get=
Prospect, and this is just a beginning. Let=E2=80=99s remember of the some =
of the most useful features we=E2=80=99ve added:

 * new field "Lead city" in our =E2=80=9CSearch by filter=E2=80=9D;
 * speeding up the search to find more leads with a new search engine;
 * spinning icon while processing the search to let you know when email sea=
rch is finished and you can export your results;
 * the leads added from plugin appear in the list right after you added the=
m without reloading the page;
 * the enhanced email verification process now validates the emails even mo=
re accurately;
 * folders to group your lists.


The Next Steps for GetProspect

Starting a new decade means new opportunities, so in 2020 we have great pla=
ns we want to bring to life.=20
We=E2=80=99re doubling down on our mission to provide quality, accurate and=
 convenient services with upcoming new features:



=F0=9F=93=AC Lead profile update


The data of the already saved lead will be auto-updated in case of some cha=
nges (ex. if they switch job places or email becomes invalid). Frequency of=
 updates will depend on how popular this profile is on LinkedIn. Also, you=
=E2=80=99ll have the ability to refresh info of lead already added with Get=
Prospect plugin.=20



=F0=9F=94=8E Live search=20


See lead search results instantly as you set search filters, and preview th=
em before saving.



=F0=9F=91=A5 CRM for already added leads=20


You=E2=80=99ll have a powerful tool to filter already added leads by any fi=
lters (ex. by country, email status, position, etc). You=E2=80=99ll be able=
 to save your custom segments and reuse them in future.=20



=F0=9F=93=9D Custom fields=20


You=E2=80=99ll be able to add custom fields to lead info, then import and e=
xport them.



=F0=9F=92=BC Lead data enrichment=20


Import your lead data and let us enrich it with data from our database (suc=
h as LinkedIn profile URL, location, company info, email, etc.)



=F0=9F=93=A9 Sending personalized emails at the right time.=20


Create email campaigns and automate sending with email a sequence. Track de=
liverability, open rate and other metrics.=20



We=E2=80=99re going to make this year a year of hard teamwork! =F0=9F=A4=9D

k.getprospect.io]

New Pricing

For those who use only verified emails, we added a new option on the subscr=
iption page: you=E2=80=99ll get two times less credits, but you will find o=
nly verified emails and charged for them.=20
On a less exciting note, we have decided to increase our prices moving forw=
ard. However, we also added Yearly subscriptions, so you can be billed annu=
ally for 12 months and you will not be impacted by this change.=20
We simplified subscriptions, so there will be no Silver and Enterprise plan=
 now.=20
Our new pricing is as follows and will take effect from January, the 24th a=
t 8:00 AM PST:

 * 1,000 discovered emails for $49/month
 * 5,000 discovered emails for $99/month
 * 20,000 discovered emails for $199/month
 * 50,000 discovered emails for $399/month=20

Such pricing change is required to boost the growth of our platform and imp=
lement significant product changes. We hope that our loyal customers won=E2=
=80=99t be affected as they can pay anually 1 year upfront with old prices =
before Jan 24. After this date, all upgrades and renewals will be done acco=
rding to the new pricing.

Upgrade for 1 year with old prices [https://getprospect.io/app/settings/sub=
scription]
 If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know! We would love t=
o hear your feedback and your thoughts on how we could improve our product.=
=20

Best regards,
Dima, Head of GetProspect=20
