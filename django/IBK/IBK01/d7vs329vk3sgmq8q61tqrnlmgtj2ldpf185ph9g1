f Entrepreneurship, Generalist Business, Finance, and Marketing to be on th=
e Business Summit panel. We believe that this summit will consist of studen=

ship opportunities. The company will have the benefit of branding/marketing=
 themselves at this event. If you are interested in being a panelist, could=
